As a **Systems Biologist**, I have a broad range of education and experience in the life sciences (including Microbiology, Genetic Engineering, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology and Biomedical Science) with an emphasis on measuring and predicting the complex interactions of biological components in dynamic living systems.  My academic training was at the University of California (undergraduate) and University of North Carolina (doctoral) with additional research conducted at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Amgen.

I recently completed a specialization in **Data Science** with distinction from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  This graduate certification program from the Department of Biostatistics is a fast-paced series of 10 courses (11 months) of comprehensive study using R Programming and other statistical computing and visualization tools necessary for big data analysis.  The exploratory and predictive techniques emphasized (including machine learning, developing products and reproducible research) augmented my scientific knowledge in experimental design, sampling and statistics.

In addition to my extensive background in science and technology, I have an MBA from the University of Alabama and have worked in various **Strategic Business** roles in Management, Marketing and IT at biotech startups, government institutions like NASA and the nonprofit SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science).  As a minority scientist (both female and part Lakota Sioux), I am passionate about diversifying STEM fields and continuing to open science for underrepresented groups.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking with my dog, exploring new places and cultures, playing guitar and writing songs, and learning mandolin and tai chi.
