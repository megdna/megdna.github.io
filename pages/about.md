As a **Systems Biologist**, I have a wide range of education and experience in the life sciences (including Microbiology, Genetic Engineering, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology and Biomedical Science) with an emphasis on measuring and predicting the complex interactions of biological components in dynamic living systems.  My academic training was at the University of California (undergraduate) and University of North Carolina (doctoral) with additional research conducted at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Amgen.

I recently completed a specialization in **Data Science** with distinction from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  This certification program from the Department of Biostatistics is a comprehensive series of 10 courses (11 months) of study using R programming and other statistical computing and visualization tools necessary for big data analysis.  The exploratory and predictive techniques emphasized, including regression models and machine learning, augmented my scientific knowledge in experimental design, hypothesis testing and statistics. I am currently applying these skills to Genomics using bioinformatic platforms such as Bioconductor and Galaxy to analyze data from next-generation sequencing experiments for cancer research and precision medicine. See some <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/WKZKD3R8QT6P" target="_blank">**Course Accomplishments**</a>.

In addition to my broad background in science and technology, I have an MBA from the University of Alabama and have worked in various **Strategic Business** roles in Management, Marketing and IT at biotech startups, government institutions like NASA and the nonprofit SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science).  As a minority scientist (both female and part Lakota Sioux), I am passionate about diversifying STEM fields and lowering the barriers to leadership for underrepresented groups. I have also been a long-time proponent of open science and citizen science, including related movements in open access publishing and open source development.  I am interested in accelerating medical research through open data and open health solutions.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking with my dog, exploring new places and cultures, playing guitar and writing songs, and learning mandolin and tai chi.  You can discover more from my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/dna">**Digital DNA**</a>.
