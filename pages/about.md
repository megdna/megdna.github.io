I have adopted the title of **Systems Biologist** to encompass my broad range of education and experience in the life sciences and medicine (including Microbiology, Genetic Engineering, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology and Developmental Biology) with an emphasis on measuring and predicting the complex interactions of biological components in dynamic living systems.  My academic training was at the University of California (undergraduate) and University of North Carolina (doctoral) with additional research conducted at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Amgen.

I am currently completing a specialization in **Data Science** with distinction from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  This "mini-Master's" from the Department of Biostatistics is a fast-paced program with 10 courses (11 months) of study using R Programming and other statistical computing and visualization tools necessary for big data analysis.

In addition to my extensive background in science and technology, I have an MBA from the University of Alabama and have worked in various **Strategic Business** roles in Management, Marketing and IT at biotech start-ups, NASA and the nonprofit SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science).  As a minority scientist (both female and part Lakota), I am passionate about diversifying and opening science.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy hiking with my dog, exploring new places and cultures, playing guitar and writing songs, and learning mandolin and tai chi.
