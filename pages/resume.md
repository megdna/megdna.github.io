#### Research Fellow in Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology (1994-1996)

Worked independently on my own research project. Was the first to detect the phenomenon of coassortment in the macronucleus of the ciliate *Tetrahymena thermophila* - long sought by biologists but never before found. Began a macronuclear map of *Tetrahymena* based on molecular and genetic evidence. Generated a new and widely used panel of 36 terminal phenotypic assortants. Published results as first author and gave several seminars and poster presentations at departmental meetings and conferences. Helped to launch many scientific projects and publications related to my work and obtain additional funding for the laboratory through national grants. Trained and supervised an undergraduate lab assistant.
