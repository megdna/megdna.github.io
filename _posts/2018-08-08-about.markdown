As a **Systems Biologist**, I have a wide range of education and experience in the life sciences (including Microbiology, Genetic Engineering, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology and Biomedical Science) with an emphasis on measuring and predicting the complex interactions of biological components in dynamic living systems.  My academic training was at the University of California (undergraduate) and University of North Carolina (doctoral) with additional research conducted at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Amgen. I am currently working in a Biophysics lab on an interactome for drug discovery, repurposing and toxicity.

I also completed a specialization in **Data Science** with distinction from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  This certification program from the Department of Biostatistics is a comprehensive series of 10 courses (11 months) of study using R programming and other statistical computing and visualization tools necessary for big data analysis.  The exploratory and predictive techniques emphasized, including regression models and machine learning, augmented my scientific knowledge in experimental design, hypothesis testing and statistics. I am applying these skills to Genomics using bioinformatics platforms such as Bioconductor and Galaxy to analyze data from next-generation sequencing experiments for cancer research and precision medicine.

In addition to my broad background in science and technology, I have an MBA from the University of Alabama and have worked in various **Strategic Business** roles in Management, Marketing and IT at biotech startups, government institutions like NASA and the nonprofit SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science).  As a minority scientist (part Cheyenne and registered Lakota), I am passionate about diversifying STEM fields and lowering the barriers to leadership for underrepresented groups. I have also been a long-time proponent of citizen science and open science, including related movements in open access publishing and open source development.  I am interested in accelerating medical discovery through open innovation and social entrepreneurship.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy nature activities (like caving, hiking and snow skiing), exploring new places and cultures, playing guitar and writing songs, and learning anything from mandolin to tai chi.
